Documentation
=============

It's probably best for you to read the `javadocs <http://javadoc.io/doc/com.thehellings/utilities>`_.

What This Is
============

Fundamentally, this is just a place where I can dump some small, useful, mostly self-contained sets of Java code that I
can reuse in other projects that I work on. Each particular class or tiny group of classes should be relatively well
contained and documented from its own javadocs.

This repository does not contain much in the way of coherent libraries. Those can be found elsewhere.
